# Light & Fight

A 2D game I've made for a game jam under the themes "Avoid the light" and "Control Many"

## Gameplay

You need to find the enemy hiding under the shadows by moving around the light source and then attack the enemy by fight player. The enemy will always try to move away from the light expose and hide under the dark shadow, meanwhile enemy will also try to damage the light source by constant attacks. 

## Controls

- You can control both Lighter and Fighter player simultaneously via movement keys WASD and Arrows respectively.
- You just need to click to attack the enemy by changing the hit direction through movement keys.
